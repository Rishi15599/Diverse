                <p>Diverse Inspection Services, Inc. is currently run by two brothers, Marco and Devan Donaldson. As native San Franciscans, they grew up in the industry while witnessing and learning from the broad changes of the City and Bay Area. From an early age they have had a multitude of exposure and experiences to general construction, dry rot repairs, real estate, and the many nuances of inspecting a home. This gives them a unique and special understanding of San Francisco and Bay Area properties. </p>
